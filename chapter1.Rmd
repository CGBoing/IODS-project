Introduction to Open Data Science.
From October to December 2020, learning the basics of open data, R, RMarkdown and GitHub.
I discovered this course on out University Yammer feed. Since it contains a lot of subjects I've been meaning to delve into, it was a no-brainer to enrol.
Looking forward to play around in RStudio and strengthen my knowledge in statistical computing!
