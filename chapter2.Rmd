# Exercise 1

<!-- *Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.* -->

Getting acquainted with RMarkdown and GitHub.
I've used Azure Repos with Git before, so I'm confident I'll be getting up to speed quickly. 

<!-- - Describe your work and results clearly.  -->
<!-- - Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods. -->
<!-- - Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using. -->

### Highlighting

Didn't find underlining though, so let's just ~~strike it through~~.
Maybe some ^superscripting^?

### Lists

* I am a bullet point.
* Me too!
